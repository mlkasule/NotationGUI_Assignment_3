## NotationGUI Project

Infix notation is the notation commonly used in arithmetical and logical formulae and statements. It is characterized by the placement of operators between operands – "infixed operators" – such as the plus sign in "2 + 2".
Postfix notation is a notation for writing arithmetic expressions in which the operands appear before their operators. There are no precedence rules to learn, and parentheses are never needed.
You will be creating a utility class that converts an infix expression to a postfix expression, a postfix expression to an infix expression and evaluates a postfix expression.
